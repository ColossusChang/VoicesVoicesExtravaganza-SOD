- MOD VERSION: 1.0
- AUTHOR: Colossus
- GAMES: BGEE+SOD, EET

## Introduction

Adds AI-generated English voiceovers for all characters from Baldur's Gate: Siege of Dragonspear, adding over 7000 lines of voiceovers. 

A counterpart of this mod for the base Baldur's Gate game can be found at [Voices Voices Extravaganza - Baldur's Gate](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate/mods/80).

## Demo
Check out a demo of this mod on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4soa5OTA6Hc)!

## Compatibility

This mod is designed to work with Baldur's Gate: Enhanced Edition (BGEE), or Enhanced Edition Trilogy (EET). When installing the mod on EET, you may install it before **or** after EET_End, either is fine.

This mod **will** work normally when installed in the middle of a playthrough.

### Compatibility with other mods

Compatibility with other mods is not guaranteed, but in theory it should not conflict with other mods. If you have other mods that add voiceover to the game, whichever mod is installed last will take precedence.

It is adviced to use this mod together with the base-game counterpart, [Voices Voices Extravaganza - Baldur's Gate](https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate/mods/80), to have a consistent experience throughout the game.

### High frame rate issues

Sometimes characters say their lines without entering the dialog mode. One example is the way SOD implements party banters. These dialogs are also voiced wherever possible. However, if you play with a high frame rate, you may notice that sometimes characters cut in on each other. This is a limitation of the game engine and not something that can be fixed easily. When this happens, either pause to listen to the dialog, or use a lower frame rate.

## Installing the mod

1. If you are installing on a BGEE+SoD game from GOG or Steam, you will need to install [Modmerge](https://github.com/ScottBrooks/modmerge/releases) or [DLCMerger](https://github.com/Argent77/A7-DlcMerger) before installing this mod.
2. Copy all contents of the compressed file to your game directory. 
3. Run `setup-vveSOD.exe` and follow the instructions.
